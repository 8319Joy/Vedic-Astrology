    "Below is a simple Python program that calculates a person's zodiac sign and gives a brief interpretation according to Indian astrology (Vedic astrology). Indian astrology primarily relies on the Moon sign and the position of planets at the time of birth.For the sake of simplicity, this example will use the Sun sign basis. To implement this, we first need to know the person's date of birth, and then we can ascertain their Sun sign according to Vedic astrology.Here's a simple Python program to compute the Sun sign based on the birth date:"
